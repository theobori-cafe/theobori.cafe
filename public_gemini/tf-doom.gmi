# Terraform chaos engineering
## 2023-06-03
I first saw

and thought it was pretty cool, so I decided to do the same for Terraform, knowing that I was working with it for professional projects.

The principle is very simple, each enemy represents a Terraform resource, if an enemy dies, the associated resource is destroyed.

## How it works ?

The main program is tf-doom', which creates a UNIX socket, listens to it and simultaneously launches an X11 virtual server (Xvfb), a VNC server (x11vnc) attached to this X session and psdoom (DOOM writing to the UNIX socket).

Everything we've just described will be encapsulated in a Docker container.

The binaries Xvfb and x11vnc are used to create a cross-platform graphical access to psdoom inside the container.

psdoom will continuously write to the UNIX socket to signal tf-doom to send Terraform resource information. When an enemy is killed, psdoom writes the associated resource name to the socket.

## Demo

This demo has been realized with the test Terraform project, every steps to reproduce it are detailed in the README file on the repository.
