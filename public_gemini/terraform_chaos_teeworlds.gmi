# Teeworlds Terraform chaos engineering
## 2024-06-05
After doing some 
=> /posts/terraform_chaos_doom/ chaos engineering for Terraform with the DOOM game
, I wanted to make a version for Teeworlds, specifically for its version 0.7 (its latest version).

The difference with the DOOM version is that in this project, a player must capture the flag for a Terraform resource to be randomly destroyed.

## How does it work?

When configuring a Teeworlds server, the values below can be entered.

```bash
# Econ configuration
ec_port 7000
ec_password "hello_world"
ec_output_level 2
```

These are prefixed with ec_ because they are associated with the econ server. This configuration binds a TCP port which will expose the Telnet protocol-based econ server.

Through the latter, we'll be able to retrieve events from the Teeworlds server, such as a message sent, a player killed or a flag captured !

## Demonstration

This demonstration has been realized with the example Terraform project, every steps to reproduce it are detailed in the README file on the repository.
