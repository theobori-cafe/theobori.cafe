<h2 class="category category-home ">Hi, I'm Théo</h2>

I support F(L)OSS and pubnixes values, I love UNIX systems, especially [NixOS](https://nixos.org/). Currently I'm maintaining [teedata.net](https://teedata.net) and I offer free [services](https://services.theobori.cafe) that respect privacy. I also love [contributing](https://repology.org/maintainer/theobori@disroot.org) to [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs).

If you're interested you can have a look at [my blog posts](/blog), everything I make is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/theobori) and [Gitea](https://links.theobori.cafe/going/5?https://git.theobori.cafe/nagi). You can also check my [public zettelkasten](https://zettel.theobori.cafe).

My links and contact details are available [here](https://links.theobori.cafe/). This website also offers a version for the [Gopher](gopher://tilde.pink:70/1/~nagi) minimal web protocol, it's also available as a [Tor hidden service](http://lojtlkafmrphjhmmksiqsabghyia353ueyfszo6mgqttxaczuata7aid.onion).
