<h2 class="category category-home ">Hi, I'm Théo</h2>

I support F(L)OSS and pubnixes values, I love UNIX systems and I also really like [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and [Nix](https://nixos.org/). Currently I'm maintaining [teedata.net](https://teedata.net) ([skins.tw](https://skins.tw) until 2024) and I offer free [services](https://services.theobori.cafe) that respect privacy.
&nbsp;
If you're interested you can have a look at [my blog posts](/blog), everything I make is open source and available [here](https://links.theobori.cafe).

<h2 class="category category-home ">Contact</h2>

I can be reached via Discord (b0th) or via <a href="mailto:nagi@tilde.team">email</a> ([PGP](/pgp.asc)).

<h2 class="category category-home ">Other protocols</h2>

This website also offers a version for the [Gemini](gemini://tilde.pink/~nagi) and [Gopher](gopher://tilde.pink:70/1/~nagi) minimal web protocols.
